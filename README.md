# Getting Started

## Requirements
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart
git clone https://github.com/count-sum/foundry-smart-contract-lottery.git
cd foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu
forge build

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Library

If you're having a hard time installing the chainlink library, you can optionally run this command. 

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Testing

```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```
